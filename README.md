This repository contains many different Trading Algorithms embedded within Jupyter Notebooks. 

ALgos:
1. Equal Weight S&P 500 -> Takes all of the companies in the S&P 500 index fund and distributes funds evenly.
Each company has the same amount of money allocated to it. Companies with higher stock prices will buy fewer shares, and similarly, companies with lower stock prices will buy more shares.
The advantage of this is that, unlike the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500, which is heavily affected by giant companies and less affected by smaller companies, this equal-weight approach ensures that losses incurred due to larger companies are of the same magnitude as losses incurred by smaller companies. Furthermore, due to this asset distribution, you can potentially make higher returns than the traditional S&P 500, as this equal-weight approach puts more emphasis on mid-sized and smaller companies, which have been shown to grow much faster than larger companies.

2. Quantitative Momentum Strategy ->
